          <h1>Hello, I'm Pinyi (Lydia) Yang</h1>
          <div class="highlight-quote">
            <p>"Data doesn‚Äôt just describe the world‚Äîit drives it. I build the bridge between insight and impact."</p>
            <p>I am a statistician üìä by training, a data scientist üíª in action, and a strategist üìà at heart. With a background in energy analytics, business intelligence, and statistical modeling, I explore how data can shape smarter decisions in sectors like energy, sustainability, and finance. I aim to turn complex datasets into clear strategies that move industries forward.</p>
          </div>
          
          <p>I am currently a Senior Analyst at <a href="https://www.fivedimensionsenergy.com/">Five Dimensions Energy LLC</a>, where I specialize in data-driven analytics to support strategic decision-making in the energy sector.</p>
          <p>Previously, I completed my Master's in <strong>Data Science</strong> at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu/">Columbia University</a>, where I gained rigorous training in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data systems, with applications ranging from energy analytics to business intelligence.</p>
          <p>I also hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in <strong>Statistics</strong> from the University of California, Los Angeles (<a href="https://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA</a>), where I developed a strong quantitative foundation and began exploring the intersection of data and real-world impact.</p>
          <p>My professional and academic experiences have shaped a strong interest in using data science to solve complex, interdisciplinary problems‚Äîespecially in domains like energy, finance, and sustainability.</p>

        <div class="additional-text">
          <h1>Topics of Interest</h1>
          <p>
            My work is grounded in the conviction that <strong>data is a powerful tool for clarity and impact</strong>. I‚Äôm passionate about building <strong>data-driven systems</strong> that bridge <strong>business intelligence</strong> and <strong>societal needs</strong> through clean design, thoughtful analytics, and ethical AI.
          </p>
          <p>
            With training in both <strong>statistics</strong> and <strong>data science</strong>, and experience across industries ranging from <strong>energy</strong> to <strong>consumer behavior</strong>, I develop solutions that transform raw data into actionable insights. I specialize in modeling <strong>complex systems</strong>, crafting <strong>explainable ML tools</strong>, and communicating results through <strong>intuitive visualizations</strong>.
          </p>
          <img src="images/wordcloud.jpg" alt="research_interest" style="margin-bottom: 2rem;" />
          <p>
            I‚Äôm especially interested in creating <strong>interpretable machine learning models</strong> for real-world impact. Whether it‚Äôs helping energy companies make greener decisions, uncovering trends in consumer behavior, or optimizing resource allocation, my focus is always on combining rigorous analysis with <strong>accessible insight</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that data systems should be <strong>equitable, transparent, and human-centered</strong>. As AI becomes further embedded in our lives, we must ask not only ‚Äúwhat works,‚Äù but ‚Äúwhat matters.‚Äù I strive to build frameworks that reflect both <strong>technical excellence</strong> and <strong>ethical responsibility</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm also intrigued by the intersections of <strong>data science and creative expression</strong>. From music recommendation engines to language-aware generative models, I‚Äôm inspired by how <strong>AI can learn from human preference</strong>‚Äîand, in turn, help us understand ourselves better.
